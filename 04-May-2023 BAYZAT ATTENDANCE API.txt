You can generate/update the token on aVendance conÞgura>on page from your Bayzat account.
Note: The exis>ng api users should renew their tokens before start consuming this api.RATE LIMITINGWe allow our client to call this API 1 >me/second. If you want to call this endpoint for huge number of data, you should increase the number of punch logs in request body. You can send maximum 20 punch logs in each call.If you try to exceed this limit, you will get hVp 429 response code from our server.WORKING PRINCIPALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS* We donÕt process the punch logs that are older than 1 week. You can track these requests on attendance raw data section on the platform.* We donÕt process the punch logs that are in the future* You can override check in values with earlier check in values only.* You can override check out values with later check out values only.* Your request payload should include distinct values for empId (or email) and time pair. Repetitive entries will be discarded from processing and marked as repetitive on the platform.* As a best practice, you should send one employeeÕs punch logs in one request.* If you send the same punch log, we donÕt process it.* In one request, you can send maximum 20 punch logs.* If you select Òincludes punch typesÓ on configuration section of Bayzat platform, we expect you to send punch type. We will be considering this punch type as your intended action.* If you select exclude punch type option on configuration section of Bayzat platform, we donÕt consider punch type that you send. We will decide the punch type based on the data that we have for particular shift.* Threshold value will be considered as check in start time for a particular shift. For example, if your work timing starts at 9am and your threshold is 60 mins, we process punch logs for that particular date starting from 8am. The punch logs that are received after 8am will be considered as attendance action. The values earlier than 8am will be considered for previous day.* Http 200 does not always mean that we successfully reflected the request to the attendance report. It will be processed and if it gets validated, it will be reflected to the attendance report.* If you would like to try your flow, we can offer you a test environment. After making sure that we have data flow between your system and Bayzat, you can start consuming our production end point. For this purpose, you can get in touch with us.Please refer to below examples to have more clarity about how Bayzat processes incoming punch logs. Work Timing : 09:00 Ð 18:00 Threshold: 60 mins.
